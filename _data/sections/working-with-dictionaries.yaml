    A dictionary consists of a collection of key-value pairs. Each key-value pair maps the key to its associated value.
    Dictionaries are Pythonâ€™s implementation of an associative array.
intro: |

    <ul>
    <li>
    We want to package pieces of information (<em>create a <strong>collection</strong></em>) that we can then later bring back up (<em><strong>access</strong></em>) using an identifier (<em><strong>key</strong></em>).</li>

    <li>
    We can for instance, package the information for a student which includes their name, age and courses taken and then bring back up the <em><strong>value</strong></em> for all those identifiers.</li>

    <li>
    We could also package information for the student's pets where there is a dog and a cat called "Mary Puppins" and "JK Meowling" respectively.</li>

    <li>
    We can create a collection for most things we can gather data for. For instance, Arsenal is <em>located</em> in <i>London</i>, their <em>stadium</em> is called <i>The Emirates</i>, the team's <em>nickname</em> is <i>The Gunners</i>, the <em>mascot</em> is called <i>Gunnersaurus</i> and the <em>manager</em> is <i>Unai Emery</i>.</li>

    <li>
    Because this is our data we already know the keys to access all the values in our "Arsenal" collection.
    </ul>

    - heading: 5.Define "student" Dictionary
    - body:
        - text: "Create student variable and set it's value as our student dictionary definition.\n
        You can define a dictionary by enclosing the comma-separated list of key-value pairs in curly braces ({}).

        * If you created a _python list_ (in step 3 above) then just replace the square brackets with curly braces.\n
        * If you created a normal list then make sure the each of the keys and the corresponding values are written as strings on either sides of the colon (:).\n
        * If you had an array as the value for _courses_ then :clap::clap::muscle:"

                    "Pulitzer":"Pulitzer Prize for Music"} )

        - text: __note:__ keywords are not __string literals__ and we are using equal (__=__) rather than colon (__:__) for assignment

        - text: run the following lines of code to inspect the data

        - code: |

                print( type( album["artist"] ) )

    - body:
        - text: "We are going to update an entry that may not be accurate in the dictionary defined in the previous step.

    - body:
        - text: The Python dict has several built in methods, __pop()__ is just one of them. pop() can be a usefully alternative to ___del___ _statement_ for removing an element.
        - text: Executing pop() __Returns__ a value which can be __captured__ as in the code below.

        - code: |

                pop_item = dictionary.pop(key, default)

    - heading: 22.Verifying an entry exists in a dictionary
    - body:
        - text: We can do this by checking if the _key_ already exists using the __in__ keyword with following syntax.
        - code: |

             key in dictionary

        - text: _A __boolean__ value is __returned___.

    - heading: 23.Verify the stadium entry no longer exists in the arsenal dictionary
    - body:
        - text: Write some code to print out the return value for checking the existence of a stadium entry using the __in__ keyword.
